# grbl-IO
grbl-IO is a collection of hardware and software for the external control of grbl-compatible controllers.  
The well-structured building blocks can then be used flexibly to control or operate different machines.
The current efforts are to create various extensions for the operation of FluidNC http://wiki.fluidnc.com/
